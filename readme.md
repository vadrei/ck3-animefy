# Make your dynasty in glorious 2D
Tired of your ruler looking like an old grandpa? Your promised spouse turned out a little on the "homely" side? Need a little facelift for your superior inbred dynasty? Say no more. Today, you can now relive history as the Nasuverse envisions it.

I am releasing this as I had much bigger plans for a Nasuverse mod a few months back until I got hit by a truck and got sent to Final Fantasy XIV land for a while. Development on that mod has tentatively resumed if I can get fellow degenerates who would like to contribute as the scale is quite a bit more than what one person can handle.

# Features

- Introducing over 900 portraits in **4K** from the Fate Grand Order game. All carefuly edited, AI upscaled and with full body artwork.
- Animefy anyone, any time, with a random portrait matching their gender.
- Or use barbershop to choose the ideal 2D Waifu/Husbando for any character!
- Children of Anime characters will of course be also rendered in glorious 2D.

# How it works

- Random Portrait: Use the **Animefy** interaction
- Chosen Portrait: Use the **Hide Portrait** interaction, then select your chosen portrait in the barbershop
- Children of anime characters are automatically given a random portrait for their gender, but can be de-animefied at any time! Just use the **Deanimefy** interaction.

# Compatibility

Animefy is as compatible as I could make it with my current knowledge of the CK3 modding tools. It should work fine with most things, as I myself run a lot of mods on my own playthroughs. But as is the nature of the beast, CK3 provides no 2D portrait support at this time and it had to be haked in. I credit the author of the [Holy Grail War](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2245363583&searchtext=Fate) mod for the mesh hack, but I have no idea if he got the solution through someone else's work.

As it stands, I have no idea if this mod will remain functional after the expansion comes out, or if it will work with mods like Elder Kings which adds custom body meshes and stuff. Once either of those comes out we shall find out.

Everything else you can think of is almost certainly compatible!

# Recruiting

As I said before, I am currently working on a Nasuverse mod. A gigantic amount of work has already been done: icons, backgrounds, traits, tooling and more, but the bulk of any mod is content, and for that I will need all the help I can get! If you can perform any of these roles, hop on discord and let me know!

- Event Writer: Preferably with the knowledge to put those events together as well, but not necessarily integrate them into gameplay. Creativity and literally craft is the main focus, as well as a deep understanding of Nasuverse lore (Tsukihime, Fate / Stay Night, FGO, etc)
- Gameplay Modder: The mod is not overly ambitious, the idea is to integrate with the vanilla gameplay through events, traits and a new focus and three new skill trees. I have already started work on many of these aspects but once again, lots to do.
